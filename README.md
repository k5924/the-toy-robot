# ToyRobot

## About The Project

The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop, of dimensions 5 units x 5 units. There are no other obstructions on the table surface. The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table. Any movement that would result in the robot falling from the table is prevented, however further valid movement commands are still allowed.
